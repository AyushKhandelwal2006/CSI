# 🧠 Freeform Digital Board  
A Neo-Brutalist, Free-Form Visual Thinking Canvas

Freeform Digital Board is a frontend-only web application that allows users to freely create, organize, and manage text and image pins on an infinite canvas.  
The project focuses on **interaction design, state management, and UX polish**, inspired by modern tools like Miro, FigJam, and Apple Freeform — but reimagined with a bold **neo-brutalist aesthetic**.

## ABOUT ME
Hi, I’m Ayush Khandelwal, a first-year B.Tech IT student with a strong interest in frontend development and UI/UX design.

Recently, I’ve worked on:

A personal portfolio website built using React, Tailwind CSS, and 3D scenes, focusing on interactive visuals and smooth animations.
A sports personality portfolio website, designed with a clean layout and modern UI.
Both projects have been successfully deployed on Vercel, and helped me gain hands-on experience with real-world frontend workflows.
